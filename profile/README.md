G'Day I'm Jon, Welcome to my projects!!

Most projects pertain to my computing setup. To aid in this I have created and am working on [Centurion ERP](https://github.com/nofusscomputing/centurion_erp). Why? Simply put there was no decent Open Source ITIM/ITSM software available that covered what was required outside of having many different systems working together to achieve the required tasks.
